We started our beautiful first date on your activa, I sat behind and we headed towards Cafe Peter, Bavdhan. It was one of the most memorable activa rides of my life. We missed a turn and took a long cut to reach the cafe. The day was filled with so many beautiful moments and emotions. If I keep writing iske aage toh pura page bhar dungaðŸ˜‚. I can never in my entire life forget this day.</p>
